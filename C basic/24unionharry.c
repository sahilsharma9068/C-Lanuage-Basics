/*1.union is very similer to structure but the differnce only difference is of memeory storage 
2.if we have to store int and char in a structure it will use 4+4=8 byte memory 4 for int and 4 for char 
3.but in union if we have to store int and char it will use only 4 byte of memory and ‚≠êstore either int or char at one time 
4.union will use storage equal to the memory of highest memory data type*/
